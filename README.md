## About Stream

Stream is a no server-side web application deploied on github page.
It is inspired by [Boop](https://boop.okat.best/) an MacOS application which can't runn
on other platforms. 
So Stream appeared. It helps to process text and expects to cover common usage scenarios.
Text looks like stream flowing from one function to another and becomes a final output.
